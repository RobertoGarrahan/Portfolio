# Portfolio — V1

This is the first version (**V1**) of my personal portfolio website, developed to present my professional profile, projects, and technical skills. The main goal of this version is to establish an online presence and showcase my work in a clean, responsive, and accessible way.

Future versions will focus on improved performance, enhanced UI/UX, animations, and deeper integration with backend services.
